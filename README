This repository provides examples of submissions for the HelloWorld puzzle in the accepted languages on gild.com

To submit solutions containing multiple files, please pack all your files into an archive and submit the archive only.
We support: zip, tar, gzip, bz2, tar+gzip, tar+bz2

E.g. (java):

$cd examples-solutions/helloworld/java/
$tar zcvf helloworld.tgz *

Please do not include binary files in your package, or your submission will be discarded (only source code and builders, like ant files or makefiles).
Try to avoid to have subfolder in your archive - this often confuses the build process (e.g. if you have 2 folders in your archive, where is your code?)
